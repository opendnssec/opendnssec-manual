# OpenDNSSEC Manual

[OpenDNSSEC](http://www.opendnssec.org/) was created as an open-source turn-key solution for DNSSEC. It
secures zone data just before it is published in an authoritative name server.

This repository contains the content visible at https://wiki.opendnssec.org/ in MkDocs markdown format,
rendered by [ReadTheDocs.org](https://www.readthedocs.org/).

It is based on content exported from the Confluence instance that previously hosted it.

Any changes to this repository automatically trigger a rebuild at ReadTheDocs via a GitHub webhook.
